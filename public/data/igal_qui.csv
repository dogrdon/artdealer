After studying art at Cooper Union in New York City and at Yale University, he moved to San Francisco in 1959. There, he attended the San Francisco Art Institute, where he eventually became an instructor. At the dances at the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco, Moscoso saw rock posters and decided that he could ""make some money doing posters for those guys."" In 1966, he began designing posters for the Family Dog and for the Avalon Ballroom. Under his own imprint, Neon Rose, he did a series for Matrix, a local nightspot. Moscoso's style is most notable for its visual intensity, which was obtained by manipulating form and color to create optical effects. Moscoso's use of contrasting colors and vibrating edges was influenced by painter Josef Albers, his teacher at Yale.

*********************************************************************************************************IGAL M: ¬¨√¨THE LAST IMPRESSIONIST?¬¨√ÆTo celebrate the coming of the 21st Century, Igal M, a talented and acclaimed artist in the 1960s in Europe and Mexico held his first shows in 2001 and 2003, after almost 30 years of absence from the world of art. ¬¨√¨I contributed to create the most sacred art, ¬¨√´life.¬¨√≠ My creation is in my wife and our two daughters, whom I devoted my life for. They gave me in return joy and happiness more than any other art can give. This was my art. I am back now with full power. Nothing was lost. My return to painting was as natural as my family.¬¨√Æ The first show, titled ¬¨√¨A Celebration of Life, Friendship and Art,¬¨√Æ which was a retrospective of paintings from 1960-2001 from Paris, Mexico, and New York, was held from June 15, 2001 ¬¨√± September 30, 2001 at the NY Information Technology Center Gallery in New York City. The follow-up show, ¬¨√¨Sunrise Sunset: Recent Paintings¬¨√Æ ran from October 18, 2003 ¬¨√± December 18, 2003 at the Art Wise Gallery in Brooklyn, NY.Igal Maoz was born in Israel in 1929. In 1960, he entered the ¬¨√¨Ecole Superieure Nationale des Beaux Arts¬¨√Æ in Paris. In the evenings, he studied drawing at the Grand Chaumiere School. Igal received recognition from the most important art critics wherever his works were shown. One of his most memorable moments was the visit of Edward G. Robinson to his show at a gallery in Los Angeles. With acclamation in his voice, Robinson said, ¬¨√¨Monet, Turner¬¨√Æ and in his letter afterward to Igal, ¬¨√¨You are possessed of fine talent and, serious and dedicated as you are, you are bound to receive recognition and perhaps sooner than some of the great masters of old.¬¨√ÆIn 1965, Igal was invited to Cuernavaca, Mexico by the famous muralist Siquieros to work on the biggest mural in the world, called ¬¨√¨La Marche de la Humanidad.¬¨√Æ The mural is now on display in Chapultapec, Mexico City. In 1967, Igal was given a one-man show at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico, which is the highest recognition for an artist in Mexico. While in Mexico, Igal met B. Traven, the enigmatic writer of this century. His most famous work is ¬¨√¨The Treasure of the Sierra Madre¬¨√Æ which was made into a movie with Humphrey Bogart. Igal was the only known person who drew a portrait of B. Traven, and it was the only image of Traven ever published in the newspapers.Selections from Igal¬¨√≠s Exhibitions:In 1964 in Bergerac, France, his painting was shown side by side with Picasso 
In 1965, he participated in the famous ¬¨√¨Salon des Independents¬¨√Æ at the Grand Palais in Paris, together with works by Bonnard, Vuillard, etc. 
In 1965, he was invited to ¬¨√¨The French Painters of our Time¬¨√Æ in the Sao Paulo Museum, Brazil 
In 1967, he had shows at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and participated in ¬¨√¨The III Bianal of Sculptors¬¨√Æ in Mexico
What the critics in Europe said about Igal¬¨√≠s work:Mask et Visage: ¬¨√¨A revelation in a young artist, painter and sculpture¬¨√ñhe arrives to a degree of superior sensitivity, reality and dreams, poetry.¬¨√Æ [Irene Mauget, Paris, 1965]Le Figaro: ¬¨√¨Igal abandons to his sensibility the outside contour of things and finds the poetry within them¬¨√ñhis painting speaks of certain Impressionists, but he borrows from no one.¬¨√Æ [Andre Larche, Paris, 1965]The Last Hour: ¬¨√¨Igal is an Israeli painter whose sensitivity is inscribed in colors of bathing Impressionist landscape, while one sometimes might imagine having been conceived in the past century. The impression is evident, rich in poetic painting.¬¨√Æ [Allan Viray, Bruxelle, 1964]¬¨√¨The ¬¨√´Toro¬¨√≠ of Igal is the coronation of power itself.¬¨√Æ [H. Adam]Instyroart:While in Mexico, Igal invented a new technique he called ¬¨√¨Instyroart¬¨√Æ and the ¬¨√¨Styrograph¬¨√Æ graphic medium, which opened a new page in the history of art and was acclaimed by the Mexican media:¬¨√¨I have seen the birth of Futurism in Italy and the evolution of Cubism in France. Also more recently, the explorations of Pop and Op Movements¬¨√ñWho can judge Igal¬¨√≠s new technique as too daring?¬¨√Æ[Gutierrez Tibon, Mexican Encyclopedia]In 1971, Igal was invited to create an Instyroart mural 40¬¨√≠ x 8¬¨√≠, called ¬¨√¨Universe, Trip into Space,¬¨√Æ at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, a science fiction writers conference in Toronto, Canada.Art Critics of Mexico:El Sol de Mexico: About the portrait of B. Traven, ¬¨√¨In this painting [Igal] manifests all the art that surges from the palette and brush of this genius painter.¬¨√Æ [Editorial, 1967]El Sol de Mexico: ¬¨√¨Igal is a Post Impressionist attracted by nature, and humans as a part of nature, human figures growing from the earth and vegetation interlace in his painting, and his art is a reflection, a poetry of his love for life.¬¨√Æ [E.Z. de Brault, 1966]¬¨√¨It is as a portraitist that Igal expresses the most powerful touch of his brush. The portrait of B. Traven is evocative, a testimony of passion. It is fascinating to see him working. In just a few seconds the colors spring from his hand, transmitting to the spectator an intense emotion.¬¨√Æ [Rosa Ellena Lujan, 1967]The Excelsior: ¬¨√¨The colors are clean, the paintings are expressive, rich in atmosphere. Immediately, you get the sense of a Neo Impressionist artist.¬¨√Æ [Margarita Nelkin, 1967]El Dia: ¬¨√¨When you see Igal¬¨√≠s paintings, you cannot help but associate with the Impressionists. It is easy to cite Monet, Van Gogh, Sisley. For me, some of his paintings make me think of the singular English painter, Turner, the true precursor of Impressionism.¬¨√Æ [A. Foppa, 1967]¬¨√¨Igal is not a ¬¨√´consecrated artist,¬¨√≠ not a member of the elite world of renowned artists, but his unique contribution to the world of art is the only portrait to be known in the world of the mysterious writer, B. Traven.¬¨√Æ [Ricardo Pina, 1967]Revista Mexicana de la Cultura: ¬¨√¨From the caves of Altamira to Picasso, painting was created on a passive surface. For the first time in pictorial art, the surface ceases to be just a simple support for the painting and it creates a play of colors, ¬¨√´Instyroart¬¨√≠ is born. It achieves the third dimension without being sculpture.¬¨√Æ [J. Pichardo, 1969]*              *             *Bio compiled by Cassiora.*********************************************************************************************************","IGAL .M PROMENADE SERIGRAPH","IGAL M ATELIER","poster","http://igalcalderpicassowarhol.com/igmprse.html","http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/yhst-133339157741621_2267_30550738",190,"http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/yhst-133339157741621_2267_30621229",,750,"IGALM3"

Igal received recognition from the most important art critics wherever his works were shown. One of his most memorable moments was the visit of Edward G. Robinson to his show at a gallery in Los Angeles. With acclamation in his voice, Robinson said, ¬¨√¨Monet, Turner¬¨√Æ and in his letter afterward to Igal, ¬¨√¨You are possessed of fine talent and, serious and dedicated as you are, you are bound to receive recognition and perhaps sooner than some of the great masters of old.¬¨√ÆIn 1965, Igal was invited to Cuernavaca, Mexico by the famous muralist Siquieros to work on the biggest mural in the world, called ¬¨√¨La Marche de la Humanidad.¬¨√Æ The mural is now on display in Chapultapec, Mexico City. In 1967, Igal was given a one-man show at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico, which is the highest recognition for an artist in Mexico. While in Mexico, Igal met B. Traven, the enigmatic writer of this century. His most famous work is ¬¨√¨The Treasure of the Sierra Madre¬¨√Æ which was made into a movie with Humphrey Bogart. Igal was the only known person who drew a portrait of B. Traven, and it was the only image of Traven ever published in the newspapers.Selections from Igal¬¨√≠s Exhibitions:
In 1964 in Bergerac, France, his painting was shown side by side with Picasso 
In 1965, he participated in the famous ¬¨√¨Salon des Independents¬¨√Æ at the Grand Palais in Paris, together with works by Bonnard, Vuillard, etc. 
In 1965, he was invited to ¬¨√¨The French Painters of our Time¬¨√Æ in the Sao Paulo Museum, Brazil 
In 1967, he had shows at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and participated in ¬¨√¨The III Bianal of Sculptors¬¨√Æ in MexicoWhat the critics in Europe said about Igal¬¨√≠s work:Mask et Visage: ¬¨√¨A revelation in a young artist, painter and sculpture¬¨√ñhe arrives to a degree of superior sensitivity, reality and dreams, poetry.¬¨√Æ [Irene Mauget, Paris, 1965]Le Figaro: ¬¨√¨Igal abandons to his sensibility the outside contour of things and finds the poetry within them¬¨√ñhis painting speaks of certain Impressionists, but he borrows from no one.¬¨√Æ [Andre Larche, Paris, 1965]The Last Hour: ¬¨√¨Igal is an Israeli painter whose sensitivity is inscribed in colors of bathing Impressionist landscape, while one sometimes might imagine having been conceived in the past century. The impression is evident, rich in poetic painting.¬¨√Æ [Allan Viray, Bruxelle, 1964]¬¨√¨The ¬¨√´Toro¬¨√≠ of Igal is the coronation of power itself.¬¨√Æ [H. Adam]Instyroart:While in Mexico, Igal invented a new technique he called ¬¨√¨Instyroart¬¨√Æ and the ¬¨√¨Styrograph¬¨√Æ graphic medium, which opened a new page in the history of art and was acclaimed by the Mexican media:¬¨√¨I have seen the birth of Futurism in Italy and the evolution of Cubism in France. Also more recently, the explorations of Pop and Op Movements¬¨√ñWho can judge Igal¬¨√≠s new technique as too daring?¬¨√Æ[Gutierrez Tibon, Mexican Encyclopedia]In 1971, Igal was invited to create an Instyroart mural 40¬¨√≠ x 8¬¨√≠, called ¬¨√¨Universe, Trip into Space,¬¨√Æ at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, a science fiction writers conference in Toronto, Canada.Art Critics of Mexico:El Sol de Mexico: About the portrait of B. Traven, ¬¨√¨In this painting [Igal] manifests all the art that surges from the palette and brush of this genius painter.¬¨√Æ [Editorial, 1967]El Sol de Mexico: ¬¨√¨Igal is a Post Impressionist attracted by nature, and humans as a part of nature, human figures growing from the earth and vegetation interlace in his painting, and his art is a reflection, a poetry of his love for life.¬¨√Æ [E.Z. de Brault, 1966]¬¨√¨It is as a portraitist that Igal expresses the most powerful touch of his brush. The portrait of B. Traven is evocative, a testimony of passion. It is fascinating to see him working. In just a few seconds the colors spring from his hand, transmitting to the spectator an intense emotion.¬¨√Æ [Rosa Ellena Lujan, 1967]The Excelsior: ¬¨√¨The colors are clean, the paintings are expressive, rich in atmosphere. Immediately, you get the sense of a Neo Impressionist artist.¬¨√Æ [Margarita Nelkin, 1967]El Dia: ¬¨√¨When you see Igal¬¨√≠s paintings, you cannot help but associate with the Impressionists. It is easy to cite Monet, Van Gogh, Sisley. For me, some of his paintings make me think of the singular English painter, Turner, the true precursor of Impressionism.¬¨√Æ [A. Foppa, 1967]¬¨√¨Igal is not a ¬¨√´consecrated artist,¬¨√≠ not a member of the elite world of renowned artists, but his unique contribution to the world of art is the only portrait to be known in the world of the mysterious writer, B. Traven.¬¨√Æ [Ricardo Pina, 1967]Revista Mexicana de la Cultura: ¬¨√¨From the caves of Altamira to Picasso, painting was created on a passive surface. For the first time in pictorial art, the surface ceases to be just a simple support for the painting and it creates a play of colors, ¬¨√´Instyroart¬¨√≠ is born. It achieves the third dimension without being sculpture.¬¨√Æ [J. Pichardo, 1969]* * *","IGAL.M.

Mikulas speaks about these pieces - ""Surely one of Shakespeare's best loved and popular plays, Romeo and Juliet is practically synonymous with the writer himself. The universal appeal of the play no doubt stems from its timeless theme of the blind persistence of innocent love. What the heart commands cannot be denied and young Romeo and Juliet, therefor, are truly heroic in stature, compelling the reader to examine his or her own experiences and motivation behind life's major decisions. That Romeo and Juliet end their lives in tragedy does not detract from the fundamental truth that love conquers all and that youth must rise over the prejudices and moral pettiness of previous generations.""""I have incorporated some of the well-known images from the play in my work; the famous balcony scene, the ball at which Romeo and Juliet first meet and the flight in the Town Square which dramatizes the feuding between the Montagues and Capulets which seeks to keep the star-crossed lovers apart. Central to my work, of course, are Romeo and juliet themselves, the lovers. Their innocence and courage are ultimately the shinning light that all too late shocks their families into ending a senseless feud.""""My lifelong love of the theater was my inspiration for this work and others in my Shakespearean suite. I hope that all the work brings to you the same mystic, love and excitement."" - {Mikulas Kravjansky 1987}","Mikulas Kravjansky ""Romeo and Juliet"" triptych of extraordinary beauty and quality.intaglio technich. on hand made paper The size of each panel is 30"" X 22"". edition size is  95. in mint condition ","Mikulas Kravjansky","poster","http://igalcalderpicassowarhol.com/mikrrandjutr.html","http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/yhst-133339157741621_2267_86461849",213,"http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/yhst-133339157741621_2267_86484296",2250,2500,"kravromeo"

Biography
With a career that has included over eighty-five one man shows and over three hundred group exhibitions, Chaki¬¨√≠s work has garnered a devoted following, and niche in contemporary Canadian art.  His work is in the permanent collections of over seventy-five museums and corporations including The Montreal Museum of Fine Art, Mus‚àö¬©e D'art Contemporain de Montreal, Fort Lauderdale Museum; Florida, Eretz Israel Museum; Israel, Mus‚àö¬©e de Toulon; France, and the Museo de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Chaki¬¨√≠s background is as diverse as the many countries that exhibit his work.  Born in Greece, of Israeli decent, and a Canadian resident since 1967, Chaki¬¨√≠s work draws on the many varied environments he has experienced.  He works mainly with landscapes and still lifes: lush, colourful scenes with forceful line work and expressive brush strokes.  His paintings are easily recognizable and are alive with emotion, visual drama, and clarity of colour.  His expressive landscapes and still lifes are emotive testaments to his enduring talent, a talent that has been recognized and applauded both in Canada and internationally.","CHAKI YEHOUDA  ""BEYOND OIL"" SERIGRAPH ","Chaki Yehouda","poster","http://igalcalderpicassowarhol.com/chyebeoilse.html","http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/yhst-133339157741621_2267_68729752",242,"http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/yhst-133339157741621_2267_69091961",,1200,"CHAKI1OIL"

*********************************************************************************************************IGAL M: ¬¨√¨THE LAST IMPRESSIONIST?¬¨√ÆTo celebrate the coming of the 21st Century, Igal M, a talented and acclaimed artist in the 1960s in Europe and Mexico held his first shows in 2001 and 2003, after almost 30 years of absence from the world of art. ¬¨√¨I contributed to create the most sacred art, ¬¨√´life.¬¨√≠ My creation is in my wife and our two daughters, whom I devoted my life for. They gave me in return joy and happiness more than any other art can give. This was my art. I am back now with full power. Nothing was lost. My return to painting was as natural as my family.¬¨√Æ The first show, titled ¬¨√¨A Celebration of Life, Friendship and Art,¬¨√Æ which was a retrospective of paintings from 1960-2001 from Paris, Mexico, and New York, was held from June 15, 2001 ¬¨√± September 30, 2001 at the NY Information Technology Center Gallery in New York City. The follow-up show, ¬¨√¨Sunrise Sunset: Recent Paintings¬¨√Æ ran from October 18, 2003 ¬¨√± December 18, 2003 at the Art Wise Gallery in Brooklyn, NY.Igal Maoz was born in Israel in 1929. In 1960, he entered the ¬¨√¨Ecole Superieure Nationale des Beaux Arts¬¨√Æ in Paris. In the evenings, he studied drawing at the Grand Chaumiere School. Igal received recognition from the most important art critics wherever his works were shown. One of his most memorable moments was the visit of Edward G. Robinson to his show at a gallery in Los Angeles. With acclamation in his voice, Robinson said, ¬¨√¨Monet, Turner¬¨√Æ and in his letter afterward to Igal, ¬¨√¨You are possessed of fine talent and, serious and dedicated as you are, you are bound to receive recognition and perhaps sooner than some of the great masters of old.¬¨√ÆIn 1965, Igal was invited to Cuernavaca, Mexico by the famous muralist Siquieros to work on the biggest mural in the world, called ¬¨√¨La Marche de la Humanidad.¬¨√Æ The mural is now on display in Chapultapec, Mexico City. In 1967, Igal was given a one-man show at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico, which is the highest recognition for an artist in Mexico. While in Mexico, Igal met B. Traven, the enigmatic writer of this century. His most famous work is ¬¨√¨The Treasure of the Sierra Madre¬¨√Æ which was made into a movie with Humphrey Bogart. Igal was the only known person who drew a portrait of B. Traven, and it was the only image of Traven ever published in the newspapers.Selections from Igal¬¨√≠s Exhibitions:In 1964 in Bergerac, France, his painting was shown side by side with Picasso 
In 1965, he participated in the famous ¬¨√¨Salon des Independents¬¨√Æ at the Grand Palais in Paris, together with works by Bonnard, Vuillard, etc. 
In 1965, he was invited to ¬¨√¨The French Painters of our Time¬¨√Æ in the Sao Paulo Museum, Brazil 
In 1967, he had shows at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and participated in ¬¨√¨The III Bianal of Sculptors¬¨√Æ in Mexico
What the critics in Europe said about Igal¬¨√≠s work:Mask et Visage: ¬¨√¨A revelation in a young artist, painter and sculpture¬¨√ñhe arrives to a degree of superior sensitivity, reality and dreams, poetry.¬¨√Æ [Irene Mauget, Paris, 1965]Le Figaro: ¬¨√¨Igal abandons to his sensibility the outside contour of things and finds the poetry within them¬¨√ñhis painting speaks of certain Impressionists, but he borrows from no one.¬¨√Æ [Andre Larche, Paris, 1965]The Last Hour: ¬¨√¨Igal is an Israeli painter whose sensitivity is inscribed in colors of bathing Impressionist landscape, while one sometimes might imagine having been conceived in the past century. The impression is evident, rich in poetic painting.¬¨√Æ [Allan Viray, Bruxelle, 1964]¬¨√¨The ¬¨√´Toro¬¨√≠ of Igal is the coronation of power itself.¬¨√Æ [H. Adam]Instyroart:While in Mexico, Igal invented a new technique he called ¬¨√¨Instyroart¬¨√Æ and the ¬¨√¨Styrograph¬¨√Æ graphic medium, which opened a new page in the history of art and was acclaimed by the Mexican media:¬¨√¨I have seen the birth of Futurism in Italy and the evolution of Cubism in France. Also more recently, the explorations of Pop and Op Movements¬¨√ñWho can judge Igal¬¨√≠s new technique as too daring?¬¨√Æ[Gutierrez Tibon, Mexican Encyclopedia]In 1971, Igal was invited to create an Instyroart mural 40¬¨√≠ x 8¬¨√≠, called ¬¨√¨Universe, Trip into Space,¬¨√Æ at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, a science fiction writers conference in Toronto, Canada.Art Critics of Mexico:El Sol de Mexico: About the portrait of B. Traven, ¬¨√¨In this painting [Igal] manifests all the art that surges from the palette and brush of this genius painter.¬¨√Æ [Editorial, 1967]El Sol de Mexico: ¬¨√¨Igal is a Post Impressionist attracted by nature, and humans as a part of nature, human figures growing from the earth and vegetation interlace in his painting, and his art is a reflection, a poetry of his love for life.¬¨√Æ [E.Z. de Brault, 1966]¬¨√¨It is as a portraitist that Igal expresses the most powerful touch of his brush. The portrait of B. Traven is evocative, a testimony of passion. It is fascinating to see him working. In just a few seconds the colors spring from his hand, transmitting to the spectator an intense emotion.¬¨√Æ [Rosa Ellena Lujan, 1967]The Excelsior: ¬¨√¨The colors are clean, the paintings are expressive, rich in atmosphere. Immediately, you get the sense of a Neo Impressionist artist.¬¨√Æ [Margarita Nelkin, 1967]El Dia: ¬¨√¨When you see Igal¬¨√≠s paintings, you cannot help but associate with the Impressionists. It is easy to cite Monet, Van Gogh, Sisley. For me, some of his paintings make me think of the singular English painter, Turner, the true precursor of Impressionism.¬¨√Æ [A. Foppa, 1967]¬¨√¨Igal is not a ¬¨√´consecrated artist,¬¨√≠ not a member of the elite world of renowned artists, but his unique contribution to the world of art is the only portrait to be known in the world of the mysterious writer, B.

*********************************************************************************************************IGAL M: ¬¨√¨THE LAST IMPRESSIONIST?¬¨√ÆTo celebrate the coming of the 21st Century, Igal M, a talented and acclaimed artist in the 1960s in Europe and Mexico held his first shows in 2001 and 2003, after almost 30 years of absence from the world of art. ¬¨√¨I contributed to create the most sacred art, ¬¨√´life.¬¨√≠ My creation is in my wife and our two daughters, whom I devoted my life for. They gave me in return joy and happiness more than any other art can give. This was my art. I am back now with full power. Nothing was lost. My return to painting was as natural as my family.¬¨√Æ The first show, titled ¬¨√¨A Celebration of Life, Friendship and Art,¬¨√Æ which was a retrospective of paintings from 1960-2001 from Paris, Mexico, and New York, was held from June 15, 2001 ¬¨√± September 30, 2001 at the NY Information Technology Center Gallery in New York City. The follow-up show, ¬¨√¨Sunrise Sunset: Recent Paintings¬¨√Æ ran from October 18, 2003 ¬¨√± December 18, 2003 at the Art Wise Gallery in Brooklyn, NY.Igal Maoz was born in Israel in 1929. In 1960, he entered the ¬¨√¨Ecole Superieure Nationale des Beaux Arts¬¨√Æ in Paris. In the evenings, he studied drawing at the Grand Chaumiere School. Igal received recognition from the most important art critics wherever his works were shown. One of his most memorable moments was the visit of Edward G. Robinson to his show at a gallery in Los Angeles. With acclamation in his voice, Robinson said, ¬¨√¨Monet, Turner¬¨√Æ and in his letter afterward to Igal, ¬¨√¨You are possessed of fine talent and, serious and dedicated as you are, you are bound to receive recognition and perhaps sooner than some of the great masters of old.¬¨√ÆIn 1965, Igal was invited to Cuernavaca, Mexico by the famous muralist Siquieros to work on the biggest mural in the world, called ¬¨√¨La Marche de la Humanidad.¬¨√Æ The mural is now on display in Chapultapec, Mexico City. In 1967, Igal was given a one-man show at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico, which is the highest recognition for an artist in Mexico. While in Mexico, Igal met B. Traven, the enigmatic writer of this century. His most famous work is ¬¨√¨The Treasure of the Sierra Madre¬¨√Æ which was made into a movie with Humphrey Bogart. Igal was the only known person who drew a portrait of B. Traven, and it was the only image of Traven ever published in the newspapers.Selections from Igal¬¨√≠s Exhibitions:In 1964 in Bergerac, France, his painting was shown side by side with Picasso 
In 1965, he participated in the famous ¬¨√¨Salon des Independents¬¨√Æ at the Grand Palais in Paris, together with works by Bonnard, Vuillard, etc. 
In 1965, he was invited to ¬¨√¨The French Painters of our Time¬¨√Æ in the Sao Paulo Museum, Brazil 
In 1967, he had shows at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and participated in ¬¨√¨The III Bianal of Sculptors¬¨√Æ in Mexico
What the critics in Europe said about Igal¬¨√≠s work:Mask et Visage: ¬¨√¨A revelation in a young artist, painter and sculpture¬¨√ñhe arrives to a degree of superior sensitivity, reality and dreams, poetry.¬¨√Æ [Irene Mauget, Paris, 1965]Le Figaro: ¬¨√¨Igal abandons to his sensibility the outside contour of things and finds the poetry within them¬¨√ñhis painting speaks of certain Impressionists, but he borrows from no one.¬¨√Æ [Andre Larche, Paris, 1965]The Last Hour: ¬¨√¨Igal is an Israeli painter whose sensitivity is inscribed in colors of bathing Impressionist landscape, while one sometimes might imagine having been conceived in the past century. The impression is evident, rich in poetic painting.¬¨√Æ [Allan Viray, Bruxelle, 1964]¬¨√¨The ¬¨√´Toro¬¨√≠ of Igal is the coronation of power itself.¬¨√Æ [H. Adam]Instyroart:While in Mexico, Igal invented a new technique he called ¬¨√¨Instyroart¬¨√Æ and the ¬¨√¨Styrograph¬¨√Æ graphic medium, which opened a new page in the history of art and was acclaimed by the Mexican media:¬¨√¨I have seen the birth of Futurism in Italy and the evolution of Cubism in France. Also more recently, the explorations of Pop and Op Movements¬¨√ñWho can judge Igal¬¨√≠s new technique as too daring?¬¨√Æ[Gutierrez Tibon, Mexican Encyclopedia]In 1971, Igal was invited to create an Instyroart mural 40¬¨√≠ x 8¬¨√≠, called ¬¨√¨Universe, Trip into Space,¬¨√Æ at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, a science fiction writers conference in Toronto, Canada.Art Critics of Mexico:El Sol de Mexico: About the portrait of B. Traven, ¬¨√¨In this painting [Igal] manifests all the art that surges from the palette and brush of this genius painter.¬¨√Æ [Editorial, 1967]El Sol de Mexico: ¬¨√¨Igal is a Post Impressionist attracted by nature, and humans as a part of nature, human figures growing from the earth and vegetation interlace in his painting, and his art is a reflection, a poetry of his love for life.¬¨√Æ [E.Z. de Brault, 1966]¬¨√¨It is as a portraitist that Igal expresses the most powerful touch of his brush. The portrait of B. Traven is evocative, a testimony of passion. It is fascinating to see him working. In just a few seconds the colors spring from his hand, transmitting to the spectator an intense emotion.¬¨√Æ [Rosa Ellena Lujan, 1967]The Excelsior: ¬¨√¨The colors are clean, the paintings are expressive, rich in atmosphere. Immediately, you get the sense of a Neo Impressionist artist.¬¨√Æ [Margarita Nelkin, 1967]El Dia: ¬¨√¨When you see Igal¬¨√≠s paintings, you cannot help but associate with the Impressionists. It is easy to cite Monet, Van Gogh, Sisley. For me, some of his paintings make me think of the singular English painter, Turner, the true precursor of Impressionism.¬¨√Æ [A. Foppa, 1967]¬¨√¨Igal is not a ¬¨√´consecrated artist,¬¨√≠ not a member of the elite world of renowned artists, but his unique contribution to the world of art is the only portrait to be known in the world of the mysterious writer, B. Traven.¬¨√Æ [Ricardo Pina, 1967]Revista Mexicana de la Cultura: ¬¨√¨From the caves of Altamira to Picasso, painting was created on a passive surface. For the first time in pictorial art, the surface ceases to be just a simple support for the painting and it creates a play of colors, ¬¨√´Instyroart¬¨√≠ is born. It achieves the third dimension without being sculpture.¬¨√Æ [J.

OHARA SHOSON began as a student of Suzuki Koson. He painted flora and fauna between 1895-1902 becoming recognized as a ""Nihonga"" painter in the 'Kacho-ga' (nature print) genre. During the Russo-Japanese war he produced a few senso-e (war prints). The majority of his early prints (1900-1912) were published by the publishers Kokkeido and Daikokuya and were designed for the foreign market. All were signed ""Koson"". Between 1912-1926 he again devoted himself to painting. Using the name 'Shoson', he returned to the woodblock medium, collaborating with the premier shin hanga publisher Watanabe. Shoson did produce some prints using the name ""Hoson
